## Question 1

*(a)*
- local: randomized response + bias correction + pj's
- centralized: laplace noise for each pj
- conjunction matrix for everything, especially for local so we do RR on y

For the local case, we a conjunction $x_i = (x_i[j] = 0, y_i = 1)$ and a local randomizer $Q(x_i)$ as:
$$
Q(x_i) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            1 & w.p. \frac{e^{\epsilon}}{e^{\epsilon}+1} \\
            0 & w.p. \frac{1}{e^{\epsilon}+1}
        \end{array}
    \right.
$$

However, we will have to correct the output of this randomizer in the aggregate, as it will be biased in expectation.

?????

$$
\begin{aligned}
  E[Q(x_i)] &= x_i\frac{e^{\epsilon}}{e^{\epsilon}+1} + (1-x_i)\frac{1}{e^{\epsilon}+1} \\
  &= x_i\frac{e^{\epsilon}-1}{e^{\epsilon}+1} + \frac{1}{e^{\epsilon}+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, our correction will need a multiplicative and an additive term. The appropriate terms are
$$
\begin{aligned}
  c &= \frac{e^{\epsilon}+1}{e^{\epsilon}-1} \\
  d &= \frac{-1}{e^{\epsilon}-1} \\
  \\
  E[c*Q(x_i) + d] &= \frac{e^{\epsilon}+1}{e^{\epsilon}-1}\left[x_i\frac{e^{\epsilon}-1}{e^{\epsilon}+1} + \frac{1}{e^{\epsilon}+1}\right] - \frac{1}{e^{\epsilon}-1} \\
  &= x_i + \frac{1}{e^{\epsilon}-1} - \frac{1}{e^{\epsilon}-1} \\
  &= x_i
\end{aligned}
$$
